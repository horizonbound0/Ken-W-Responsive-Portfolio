                    <h3>About Me:</h3>

                    Born to a military family, I've called many places home, but am currently based in Austin, Texas.
                    I've loved creating experiences and content for people to enjoy ever since I was a child. Being
                    older than THE INTERNET, I've always been facinated with how experessive and engaging the
                    world-wide-web can be. With a bachelor's in Video Game Design and completion of an intense Full
                    Stack Web Developement bootcamp from the University of Texas, Austin, I'm incredibly excited to
                    leave my stamp in browsers across the world.

                <article>Take a look at my works and projects below. You'll find that I strive to create a comfortable,
                    accessible, and fun experience for my users. I firmly believe these traits can be successfully
                    applied to any and all corners of the internet. I look forward to hearing from you.</article>

                This was my first web-app! Knowing myself as I faced an intense tidal wave of information about web
                developement I realized I would need a place to keep notes. What better way than a web page? Not
                only would it be a centralized place I could go to view the information I've learned, but it would
                also be a great sandbox for me to practice my skills.

                I have always loved tabletop roleplaying games, and one of my favorite game systems is Pathfinder,
                by Paizo. When they approached me to create a web app for users to create characters to play in the
                Pathfinder world, I was estatic.
